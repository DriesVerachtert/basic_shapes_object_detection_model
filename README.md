# Basic Shapes Object Detection Model

## Description

This is a model based on facebook/detr-resnet-50 which is fine-tuned to detect very basic shapes like circles, squares and triangles.

It's trained on the dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/driesverachtert/basic_shapes_object_detection . The code which was used to create that dataset can be found at https://github.com/DriesVerachtert/basic_shapes_object_detection_dataset 

This model itself can be downloaded from the HuggingFace Hub at https://huggingface.co/driesverachtert/basic_shapes_object_detection . The code which was used to train the model can be found at https://github.com/DriesVerachtert/basic_shapes_object_detection_model
